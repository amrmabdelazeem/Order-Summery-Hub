## My process

  I've built the HTML first as planned, then started styling each block at once. Finally applied the responsive web design patterns.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Buttons
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- VS CODE

### What I learned

I managed to solve the responsive design part turning the project from mobile view to a desktop view.

### Useful resources
